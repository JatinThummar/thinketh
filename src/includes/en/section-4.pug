	h2 Thought and Purpose
	p
		| Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent
		| accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to
		| &quot;drift&quot; upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such
		| drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of
		| catastrophe and destruction.
	p
		| They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to
		| petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings, all of which are
		| indications of weakness, which lead, just as surely as deliberately
		| planned sins (though by a different route), to failure, unhappiness,
		| and loss, for weakness cannot persist in a power evolving universe.
	p
		| A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set
		| out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing
		| point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or
		| it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time
		| being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his
		| thought-forces upon the object, which he has set before him. He
		| should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself
		| to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into
		| ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings. This is the royal road
		| to self-control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails
		| again and again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must
		| until weakness is overcome), the 
		em strength of character gained
		|  will
		|     be the measure of 
		em his true
		|  success, and this will form a new
		|     starting-point for future power and triumph.
	p
		| Those who are not prepared for the apprehension of a 
		em great
		|  purpose
		|     should fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their
		|     duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in
		|     this way can the thoughts be gathered and focussed, and resolution
		|     and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which
		|     may not be accomplished.
	p
		| The weakest soul, knowing its own weakness, and believing this truth
		em that strength can only be developed by effort and practice,
		|  will,
		|     thus believing, at once begin to exert itself, and, adding effort to
		|     effort, patience to patience, and strength to strength, will never
		|     cease to develop, and will at last grow divinely strong.
	p
		| As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and
		| patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong
		| by exercising himself in right thinking.
	p
		| To put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with
		| purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only
		| recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all
		| conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly,
		| and accomplish masterfully.
	p
		| Having conceived of his purpose, a man should mentally mark out a
		em straight
		|  pathway to its achievement, looking neither to the right
		|     nor the left. Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded; they
		|     are disintegrating elements, which break up the straight line of
		|     effort, rendering it crooked, ineffectual, useless. Thoughts of
		|     doubt and fear never accomplished anything, and never can. They
		|     always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong
		|     thoughts cease when doubt and fear creep in.
	p
		| The will to do springs from the knowledge that we 
		em can
		|  do. Doubt
		|     and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages
		|     them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.
	p
		| He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. His
		| every thought is allied with power, and all difficulties are
		| bravely met and wisely overcome. His purposes are seasonably
		| planted, and they bloom and bring forth fruit, which does not fall
		| prematurely to the ground.
	p
		| Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force: he who
		em knows
		|  this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a
		|     mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations; he who
		em does
		|  this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his
		|     mental powers.
