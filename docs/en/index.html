      <h1>As a Man Thinketh</h1>
      <p>This book will help you understand how your thoughts shape your character, circumstances, and, ultimately, your destiny.</p>
      <h2>Effect of Thought on Circumstances</h2>
      <p>Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts.</p>
